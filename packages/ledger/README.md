## Overview

Ledger is the finance and billing extension for GridX. It adds a complete financial management layer to the GridX console, including double-entry bookkeeping, customer invoicing, invoice templates, digital wallets, payment gateway processing, immutable transaction history, and standard financial reports.

Ledger ships as both a Laravel package and an Ember engine. The backend package provides the accounting models, services, routes, gateway drivers, events, observers, migrations, and console commands. The frontend engine provides the Ledger console experience for billing, payments, accounting, reports, and settings.

Ledger is included with standard GridX installations. See the [GridX Ledger documentation](https://www.gridx.io/docs/ledger) for the product guide, concepts, and setup walkthroughs.

## Architecture

Ledger is split into two distributable packages:

| Package | Runtime | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`gridx/ledger-api`](https://packagist.org/packages/gridx/ledger-api) | Laravel / PHP | Backend models, routes, services, migrations, gateway drivers, observers, events, resources, reports, and console commands. |
| [`@fleetbase/ledger-engine`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fleetbase/ledger-engine) | Ember | GridX console engine for the Ledger dashboard, billing, payments, accounting, reports, and settings screens. |

Backend routes are mounted under the configured Ledger API prefix, which defaults to `ledger`.

| Route group | Authentication | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /ledger/webhooks/{driver}` | Public, driver verified | Payment gateway webhook callbacks. |
| `/ledger/public/invoices/{public_id}` | Public | Customer invoice view, gateway list, and payment flow. |
| `/ledger/v1/wallet/*` | API key | Customer and driver wallet API endpoints. |
| `/ledger/int/v1/*` | GridX session | Console APIs for accounts, invoices, journals, wallets, transactions, gateways, settings, and reports. |

The Ember engine mounts at the GridX extension route `ledger` and exposes console sections for billing, payments, accounting, reports, and settings.

## Requirements

- PHP `^8.0`
- Composer
- GridX Core API
- GridX FleetOps API
- Node.js `>=18`
- pnpm
- Ember CLI compatible with the workspace

## Installation

Ledger comes pre-installed with GridX. In a standard GridX instance, open the console sidebar and navigate to Ledger to begin. Default accounts and wallets are provisioned automatically for new companies and users.

For package-level installation:

```bash
composer require gridx/ledger-api
```

```bash
pnpm install @fleetbase/ledger-engine
```

If you are adding Ledger to an existing GridX installation, run migrations through your normal GridX deployment flow, then provision defaults for existing records:

```bash
php artisan ledger:provision
```

## Development

### GridX workspace linking

When working on Ledger inside a full GridX checkout, use GridX's package linker from the repository root instead of hand-editing `console/package.json`, `api/composer.json`, or `console/pnpm-workspace.yaml`.

Install the linker once from the GridX repository root:

```bash
npm link
```

Enable Ledger as a local development package:

```bash
flb-package-linker enable ledger
flb-package-linker install ledger
```

Use `--install` to let the linker run the required package-manager commands immediately:

```bash
flb-package-linker enable ledger --install
```

Check link state with:

```bash
flb-package-linker status
flb-package-linker doctor
```

See the [GridX development setup guide](https://www.gridx.io/docs/platform/quickstart/development-setup) for Docker mounts, local Ember dev server setup, package-linker details, and unlink/reset commands. GridX runs Laravel Octane, so reload the API worker after PHP changes:

```bash
docker compose exec application php artisan octane:reload
```

### Package-level development

Install dependencies:

```bash
composer install
pnpm install
```

Run the Ember engine locally:

```bash
pnpm start
```

Frontend checks:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

Backend checks:

```bash
composer test:lint
composer test:types
composer test:unit
composer test
```

Ledger Artisan commands:

```bash
php artisan ledger:provision
php artisan ledger:backfill-direction
php artisan ledger:update-overdue-invoices
```

`ledger:provision` is idempotent and can target all companies, one company, accounts only, or wallets only. `ledger:backfill-direction` fills missing transaction directions on older transaction rows. `ledger:update-overdue-invoices` marks sent or viewed invoices as overdue when their due date has passed.

## API and Extension Points

Ledger exposes backend services for accounting, wallets, invoices, and payments:

- `LedgerService` creates double-entry journal entries and powers financial reports.
- `WalletService` manages wallet provisioning and balance-changing operations.
- `InvoiceService` creates and manages invoices, including order-based invoice creation.
- `PaymentService` coordinates gateway charges, refunds, setup intents, events, and gateway transaction persistence.
- `PaymentGatewayManager` resolves and initializes configured payment gateway drivers.

Custom payment gateways can extend `AbstractGatewayDriver` and implement the `GatewayDriverInterface` contract. Gateway drivers provide a code, name, capability list, configuration schema, purchase/refund behavior, and optional webhook or tokenization support.

Ledger also registers invoice template context variables with GridX's template rendering system so invoice templates can reference invoice, transaction, account, and wallet data during rendering.
